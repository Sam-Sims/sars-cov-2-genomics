# Introduction to NGS Sequencing Data

::: highlight

**Questions**

- What are some of the common file formats used in bioinformatics?
- How do I assess the quality of Illumina sequencing data?

**Learning Objectives**

- Recognise the structure of common file formats in bioinformatics such as FASTA, FASTQ, FAST5 and BED.
- Use FastQC to produce a quality report for Illumina sequences. 
- Use MultiQC to produce a report compiling multiple quality statistics.
- Use MinIONQC to produce quality plots from ONT base calling software.

Some notes about FAST5 files:

Ideas:

- Provide a pre-aligned BAM file to visualise in IGV (e.g. the nanopore data are quite interesting - because there's loads of errors, highlighting the importance of high depth of sequencing).
